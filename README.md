## About the Project
My project is will focus on the 33,358 records of Propublica.org published
NYPD complaint records between 1994-2020. I wanted to see if police officers were 
being held accountable after recieving a substaintuated allegation of misconduct. The data set can
be downloaded on the website https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/civilian-complaints-against-new-york-city-police-officers
or you can download this repository.

## Getting Started
  1. Download/Clone the repo
  2. The "allegations_20200726939.csv" file is the data set from Propublica.org
  2. Open the Jupyter notebook file and make sure all csv files are in the same directory
  4. The Jupyter notebook file will guide you through all my analysis
